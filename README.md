# math1
Here is an example of using Python to teach math to children.

This program presents the child with 10 addition problems and 10 subtraction problems, using randomly generated numbers between 1 and 10. The child is prompted to enter their answer, and the program gives feedback on whether the answer is correct or not. This simple program can be a useful tool for teaching basic math skills to children in a fun and interactive way using Python.

You can run this on terminal using for example "Python3 math1.py"
As usual you need to either install pyinstall or some other exporter to get this in full program version.
